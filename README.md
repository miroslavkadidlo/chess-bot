## Introduction

**Used technologies and pages:**

- [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) is the most popular chess website and mobile application for playing chess.
- [stockfish.online](https://stockfish.online/) - stockfish is the most popular and powerfull chess engine which can evaluate best move with depth of moves.
- [cypress.io](https://cypress.io) is most popular JS/TS test framework for writing automated tests.

## How it works?

### 1. First of all, it need to start the game.

Fixed wiewport sets to: cy.viewport(1000, 660)

There are also several settings available to change in /fixtures folder as:

- langageMutations.json
- playerLevel.json
- stockFishDepth.json

### 2. As first move are chosen:

Before that, we need to check what color do we have. It will be find via cy.getMyPlayerColor()

- for white: KingÂ´s Pawn Opening - e4
- for black: as defense - kc6

Parametrized first move can be parametrized and changed in the future in fixture file.

Waiting for every turn is handled by loop with cy.get('[data-ply=x]').should(be.visible) which x is step of opponent move.

### 3. It needs scan all moves from chess.com [data-cy="move-list"]

It is handled by cy.scanMovesFromChessMoveList() with populate each nodes to array.

### 4. If I have all moves, I need to compute evaluation and get best move from stockfish.online

It is handled by cy.getBestMove(listOfMoves), which will be converted from algebraic notation to FEN and then will be sended via cy.request() to stockfish.online for best move request.

### 5. Action with cy.move()

It is handled by cy.move() custom command which needs to calculate chess board from coordinates - to coordinates.
